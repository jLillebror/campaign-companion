### 20/05/2024 UPDATE
A front-end and back-end version of this product is now here. It is no longer a prototype. It is still simple, and it gives the user the ability to create a campaign and add characters to it. In a campaign, they are able to put information such as campaign name, description, campaign setting and what type of game system is being used for it. Little has changed from the prototype.

Same goes for adding characters and notes. It is kept simple, and you are able to create a character and add them onto a campaign.

Only thing that is lacking from the protoype is the Contact Page.
